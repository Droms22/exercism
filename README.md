# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

I use both the [Exercism CLI](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally) and the [Online Editor](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/using-the-online-editor) to fetch and submit solutions.  

## How it's organized

- Each top-level directory corresponds to a different language track (e.g. `csharp`, `javascript`, `typescript`, etc.).
- Inside each language directory, there is a directory for each exercise.

## Syncing

The exercises are synchronized using the official [GitHub Syncer](https://exercism.org/settings/github_syncer) feature kindly provided by the platform.
